This code let you send aprs position report, using telegram and esp8266
Just simply sharing your gps position, live position sharing is still in working just remind to change the value "int period = 300000;" with refresh in ms (like 5min 10 min etc)
(telegram live gps sharing refresh the position every 30 seconds)
!! ATTENTION NOTE !!
when you boot up your ESP8266, you need to wait the "period" time before share the position (both live or static GPS)
